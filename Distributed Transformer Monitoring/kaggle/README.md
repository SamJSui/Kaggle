# About Dataset
Transformers plays a very important role in the power system. Though they are some of the most reliable component of the electrical grid they are also prone to failure due to many factors both internal or external. There could be many initiators which cause a transformer failure, but those which can potentially lead to catastrophic failure are the following :
Mechanical Failure
Dielectric Failure
